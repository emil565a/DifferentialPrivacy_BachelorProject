1. Introduction 
    The Project.ipynb file contains all the code developed in relation to this project. 
    



2. Requirements
    The project have been developed in Python 3.9.10 (64-bit), using the Jupyter Lab Notebook functionality.
    (https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html#)
    In order to run the code the following is required:
      
    2.1 Python 3.9.10 (64-bit): 
        Installation Guide: https://realpython.com/installing-python/
        
    For Easy Setup of Jupyter, get the Python Package Index (pip) 
    https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/.
    This should be automatically installed, when installing Python3
    
    2.2 Jupyter Lab:  
        Method 1: "pip isntall jupyterlab"
        Method 2: https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html
        
    2.3 Jupyter Notebook 
        Method 1: "pip install notebook"


3. Opening and runing the code 
    Steps: 
        3.1: 
            - cd to the folder containing the project 
            - Install the needed modules via "pip install -r requirements.txt"

        3.2: 
            3.2.1 Open the notebook in either: 
                1. Visual Studio Code (Easiest Way): 
                    1.1. cd to the project folder
                    1.2. Open via: "code ."
                    1.3  Open the Project.ipynb 
                    1.4  Select Python 3.9.10 Kernel
                    1.5 Press Run All 
            
                2. Jupyter NoteBook:
                    2.1. cd to the project folder 
                    2.2. open via: "jupyter notebook Project.ipynb"
            3.2.2: Run the code either cell by cell, or all at once
